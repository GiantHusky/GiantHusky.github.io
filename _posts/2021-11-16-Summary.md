# Brief Summary
// A brief summary of the past 6 months and a usage doc of some latest used tools 

## 1. Tmux

A rather useful Screen-like tool to hang process. 

Usage: 

`tmux`
//Start a new window to contain process

`<ps>`
//Run the process u need to hang

Press cmd(ctrl)+B and then release, press D afterwards

The process has already been hang for now. To check the current status of the process in backstage, run `tmux ls` to get all the sessions u've opened. Check the exact number of the session u wanna get.

`tmux at -t <number>`
//Where <number> is the one u got from the last operation above.

To shut down a no longer useful session, run `tmux kill-window -t <number>` 
//where <number> is the number of the session u wanna shut dowm.

## 2. Axel

An extremely helpful download tool on Linux.

To install **Axel** on a machine, run `sudo apt install axel`

### Common params of **Axel**:

`-a` //To combine all the outputs into one message

`-c` //Allow continously restart of downloading

`-n <amount>` //Multiple processes while downloading, where <amount> is the amounts of parallel threads u wanna set

## 3. TBD
